        Music in the Marching Band

        <p>
            Even though Alan was the only child not to take piano lessons, that did not stop him from pursuing piano. Alan learned piano by ear and learned from mimicking YouTube videos.   

            <br><br>

            In highschool, he was involved in the marching band, learning how to play the keyboard, battery, and auxiliary percussion. He was also involved in chorus as a tenor and bass, singing for the varsity choir.

            <br><br>

            Alan joined a band where he played the drumset and keyboard, though it was pretty short-lived.

            After Alan graduated, he spent a year volunteering full-time for his Church as split between a technology consultant, and a volunteer in the humanitarian aid program helping those in the clergy and congregation better use technology for outreach and communication and helping those in need.
            
            During this time, he learned how to effectively communicate with others, work in a team, and solve problems. He also improved his Spanish to speak fluently.

        Data Science and Statistics

            During his studies, he was involved in the Data Science Society where he served as President. He was a TA for five courses in the Mathematics Department and ran the data science lab where he trained tutors and helped students with their data science projects.
            
            He even won a few hackathons!

            He was awarded the SHPE BYUI National Convention Scholarship from Si Se Puede Scholarship Foundation on top of being a full Pell Grant recipient.
