    "text": "The General Social Survey (GSS) is a nationally representative survey of American adults that has been conducted since 1972. The GSS is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, and it is widely considered to be one of the most important sources of data on trends in American attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.\nShow the code\n# df_raw &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"posts/usa_christian/GSS.xlsx\")\n\ndf_raw &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"GSS.xlsx\")\nRise of ‘None’\nOne of the key findings of the GSS is that Christianity in the United States is in decline. In the early 1970s, around 90% of Americans identified as Christian, but by 2020, that number had dropped to around 70%. This decline is particularly pronounced among young adults, with only around half of adults under the age of 30 identifying as Christian.\nOne of the main reasons for this decline is the rise of the “Nones” - a term used to describe people who do not identify with any particular religion. The number of Nones in the United States has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, and by 2020, around one in four Americans identified as Nones.\nShow the code\nf = df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . %in% c(\"Protestant\",\"Catholic\",\"Orthodox-christian\") , \"Christian\"))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . %in% c(\"Buddhism\",\"Hinduism\",\"Other eastern religions\",\"Inter-nondenominational\",\"Native american\",\"Other\",\"Muslim/islam\") , \"Other\"))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, relig) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;%\n  filter(!relig %in% c(\".n:  No answer\", \".d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\",\".s:  Skipped on Web\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year), y = percent, color = relig)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    color = \"Religion\",\n    title = \"Percent Religon Over Time\"\n  ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nf %&gt;% ggplotly()\nNew Christians\nWhile Christianity as a whole is in decline, the decline has not been evenly distributed across different denominations.

On the other hand, the proportion of Protestants has seen a slight decline, dropping from around 55% in the 1970s to around 45% in 2020.\nOther branches of Christianity, such as Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Eastern Orthodoxy, have seen an increase in recent years. By 2020, these denominations made up around 5% of the U.S. population, a significant increase from their representation in the 1970s.\nShow the code\nchristian_vector &lt;- c('PROTESTANT','CATHOLIC','CHRISTIAN','ORTHODOX-CHRISTIAN') %&gt;% tolower()\n\nf = df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  filter(tolower(relig) %in% christian_vector) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . ==  \"Orthodox-christian\" , \"Christian\"))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . ==  \"Christian\" , \"Other\"))) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, relig) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year), y = percent, color = relig)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    color = \"Denomination\",\n    title = \"Percent Christian Denomination Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nf %&gt;% ggplotly()"

    "text": "Strength of Christians\nAnother aspect of the decline of Christianity in the United States is the weakening of its strength within the population. This can be seen in the decreasing participation in religious practices such as church attendance.\nAccording to the GSS, the proportion of general Christians who do not attend church has increased from 15% in 1970 to 23% in 2020. Additionally, the proportion of Christians who attend church weekly has declined from 41% in 1970 to 36% in 2020. However, the proportion of Christians who attend church either monthly or less frequently has remained relatively stable.\nThis decline in church attendance is particularly pronounced among young Christians. The proportion of young Christians who attend church weekly or more frequently has decreased in all categories, except for the “seldom” category in which young Christians increased from 23% in 1970 to 45% in 2020.\nTechnical Note: This code is using the tidyverse and patchwork library to analyze and create a plot of church attendance among Christians over time. The code first filters the dataframe to only include rows where the “age” column contains numeric values, and then converts the “age” and “year” columns to numeric format. Next, it combines all Christian denominations as a single variable called “Christian”, and then filters to only Christians. The code replaces the several different categories of church attendance to Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, and Seldom. The code then groups and counts how many people in each category and uses “ggplot” to make a visualization.\n\n\nShow the code\nchristian_attend &lt;- df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(age = as.numeric(age)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(age = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(age), 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . %in% c(\"Protestant\",\"Catholic\",\"Orthodox-christian\") , \"Christian\"))) %&gt;% \n  filter(relig == \"Christian\") %&gt;% \n  filter(!attend %in% c(\".d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\",\".s:  Skipped on Web\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"Every week\",\"Nearly every week\",\"Several times a week\"), \"Weekly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"2-3 times a month\",\"About once a month\",\"At least monthly\"), \"Monthly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"About once or twice a year\",\"Several times a year\"), \"Yearly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"Less than once a year\",\"Never\"), \"Seldom\", attend)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(attend = factor(attend, levels = c(\"Weekly\", \"Monthly\", \"Yearly\",\"Seldom\"))) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"Attendance\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nChristians Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = 'none')\n  \n\ndf_christian &lt;- df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(age = as.numeric(age)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(age = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(age), 10)) %&gt;% \n  filter(!attend %in% c(\".d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\",\".s:  Skipped on Web\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"Every week\",\"Nearly every week\",\"Several times a week\"), \"Weekly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"2-3 times a month\",\"About once a month\",\"At least monthly\"), \"Monthly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"About once or twice a year\",\"Several times a year\"), \"Yearly\", attend),\n         attend = ifelse(attend %in% c(\"Less than once a year\",\"Never\"), \"Seldom\", attend)) %&gt;% \n  filter(attend != \".n:  No answer\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(attend = factor(attend, levels = c(\"Weekly\", \"Monthly\", \"Yearly\",\"Seldom\"))) \n\nchristian_attend_youth &lt;- df_christian %&gt;%\n  filter(age %in% c(20,30)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"Attendance\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nChristian Youth Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    # legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\"\n    )\n\n\nchristian_attend + christian_attend_youth & scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.1, .46),labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength of Protestants\nWhile overall Christianity in the United States is in decline, the decline has not been evenly distributed across different denominations. In particular, the decline of Protestant Christianity appears to be less pronounced than that of Christianity as a whole.\nWhen it comes to church attendance, the data shows that weekly attendance among Protestants has remained relatively stable. According to the GSS, the proportion of Protestants who attend church weekly has remained around 35% since 1970. Furthermore, the weekly attendance for both general Protestants and young Protestants actually increased slightly.\n\n\nShow the code\nprot_attend &lt;- df_christian %&gt;% \n  filter(relig == \"Protestant\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"Attendance\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nProtestants Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() +  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n\nprot_attend_youth &lt;- df_christian %&gt;%\n  filter(relig == \"Protestant\") %&gt;% \n  filter(age %in% c(20,30)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nProtestant Youth Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    # legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\"\n    )\n\n\n\nprot_attend + prot_attend_youth & scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.1, .42),labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrength of Catholics\nWhile Christianity as a whole is in decline, the decline has not been evenly distributed across different denominations. Among all Christian denominations, the Catholic Church appears to be the one that has been most affected by the decline in attendance.\nAccording to the GSS, weekly attendance among Catholics has decreased significantly since 1970. Among general Catholics, weekly attendance dropped from 53% to 27% during this time period. Similarly, weekly attendance among Catholic youth has also decreased, declining from 40% in 1970 to 15% in 2020.\nHowever, the decline in attendance has not been limited to weekly attendance. The proportion of Catholics who attend church seldom or less frequently has also increased. Seldom attendance increased from 11% in 1970 to 26% in 2020. Furthermore, the youth seldom attendance doubled from 12% to 24% in 2020.\n\n\nShow the code\ncath_attend &lt;- df_christian %&gt;%\n  filter(relig == \"Catholic\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"Attendance\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nCatholics Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = 'none')\n\ncath_attend_youth &lt;- df_christian %&gt;%\n  filter(relig == \"Catholic\") %&gt;% \n  filter(age %in% c(20,30)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year,attend) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = percent, group = attend, color = attend)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"\",\n    color = \"Attendance\",\n    title = \"Church Attendance Among\\nCatholic Youth Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    # legend.position = 'bottom',\n    legend.direction = \"vertical\"\n    )\n  \n\ncath_attend + cath_attend_youth & scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.1, .54),labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharting the decline\nIn conclusion, this blog post has discussed the decline of Christianity in the United States over the past few decades, as reported by the GSS. The data shows that the proportion of Christians in the U.S. population has dropped from around 90% in the early 1970s to around 70% in 2020.\nThe decline of Christianity is also reflected in the weakening of its strength within the population, as seen in the decreasing participation in religious practices such as church attendance. The proportion of general Christians who do not attend church has increased from 15% in 1970 to 23% in 2020 and the proportion of Christians who attend church weekly has declined from 41% in 1970 to 36% in 2020. However, the proportion of Christians who attend church either monthly or less frequently has remained relatively stable.\nWhen looking at different Christian denominations, the decline of Protestant Christianity appears to be less pronounced than that of Christianity as a whole. The proportion of Protestants who attend church weekly has remained around 35% since 1970, and weekly attendance for both general Protestants and young Protestants actually increased slightly. On the other hand, the Catholic Church appears to be the one that has been most affected by the decline in attendance. Among general Catholics, weekly attendance dropped from 53% to 27% during this time period, and the youth seldom attendance doubled from 12% to 24% in 2020.\nThe term “Chreaster” is defined as such: “A Christian who does not frequently attend church, attending only on the major holidays of Christmas and Easter.” (Wiktionary) Chreasters have been on the increase especially among younger Christians and Catholics.\nWhile this blog post does not try to explain the ‘why’ in this phenomenon, there are several factors that readers can probably think of that have led to this decline. Some of the possible factors include the increasing secularization of American society, the rise of social media and the internet, the growing diversity of American society, the sexual abuse scandals that have plagued the Catholic Church, and the loss of trust and credibility among Catholics."

He was one of the last kids at the adoption center to get a home!\n\n            According to the Korean Family Registry, he is the head of the Hanyang Koo Clan in South Korea (since he is the only member)\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        Adopted to America\n\n        \n\n        \n            The Averett's adopted Alan and brought him to Phoenix Arizona in the United States. He became the youngest of 5 children. \n            \n            His mother's family was from California and Mexico and his father's family from Wyoming. \n            \n            Throughout his life, his mother worked in education and his father worked in sales with companies across India and Asia.\n\n            Before living in Arizona, the four Averett children before Alan were raised in Springfield, Ohio! A small town in the midwest\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n        \n\n        Eagle Scout in Texas\n\n        \n\n        \n            While Alan was growing up in Texas, he joined the Boy Scouts of America, serving as the Scribe in his troop. In 2018, he earned the rank of Eagle Scout.\n\n            His Eagle Scout project was to run community service events partering with the Pajama Program for disadvantaged youth in the local Austin area. \n            \n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n        \n\n        Music in the Marching Band\n\n        \n\n        \n            Even though Alan was the only child not to take piano lessons, that did not stop him from pursuing piano. Alan learned piano by ear and learned from mimicking YouTube videos.   \n\n            \n\n            In highschool, he was involved in the marching band, learning how to play the keyboard, battery, and auxiliary percussion. He was also involved in chorus as a tenor and bass, singing for the varsity choir.\n\n            \n\n            Alan joined a band where he played the drumset and keyboard, though it was pretty short-lived.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n        \n\n        Competing in the Business Club \n\n        \n\n        \n            Alan, along with his friends, joined and competed in his school's business club, called DECA. He helped run a public relations campaign, partnering with TerraCycle, an innovative recycling company that has become a global leader in recycling hard-to-recycle materials.\n\n            They won regional, state, and went on to compete at the international level in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n\n        \n\n        Taekwondo to Tire Repair\n\n        \n\n        \n            Alan has always been eager to work from a young age. In Texas, he took on a variety of jobs- working at a bakery (as a dishwasher), instructing at a martial arts studio, and fixing tires as a tire repair technician. \n\n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        Volunteer work in Maryland\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            After Alan graduated, he spent a year volunteering full-time for his Church as split between a technology consultant, and a volunteer in the humanitarian aid program helping those in the clergy and congregation better use technology for outreach and communication and helping those in need.\n            \n            During this time, he learned how to effectively communicate with others, work in a team, and solve problems. He also improved his Spanish to speak fluently.\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        Data Science and Statistics\n\n        \n\n        \n            When Alan entered university, he ultimately decided to study data science since it combined his interests in statistics, and computer programming. \n\n            During his studies, he was involved in the Data Science Society where he served as President. He was a TA for five courses in the Mathematics Department and ran the data science lab where he trained tutors and helped students with their data science projects.\n            \n            He even won a few hackathons!\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n\n        \n\n        Hispanic Scholarship \n\n        \n\n        \n            During university, Alan was a founding member of SHPE, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Though not a typical Hispanic person, since he had Hispanic heritage from his mother, he could better relate to the Hispanic experience and community.\n\n            He was awarded the SHPE BYUI National Convention Scholarship from Si Se Puede Scholarship Foundation on top of being a full Pell Grant recipient.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        Pollster in DC\n\n        \n\n        \n            A pollster in Washington DC hired Alan as a Data Science Intern. He worked right on Capitol Hill to help garner information about the 2022 midterm elections. He analyzed voter data trends, applying them to machine learning models.\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n\n        \n\n        Visiting Fellow at the Youth in Policy Institute \n\n        \n\n        \n            Unrelated to his work as a pollster, Alan is also a Visiting Fellow at the Youth in Policy Institute. He worked with a team of youth and young adults to research and write policy papers on issues affecting youth in the United States.\n\n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        The Best Decision of His Life\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            Alan met Audrey Mae in the same data engineering class. After some skateboard dates and boba, Alan knew she was the one. Alan proposed to Audrey in Tokyo Japan, and they were married in a court house in Salt Lake City, Utah. \n\n            Audrey Mae happened to be a better data scientist and data engineer than Alan, working as a data engineer for a health data company in Utah.\n            \n        \n\n        \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n\n        \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n\n        Full-time Job with the Navy\n\n        \n\n        \n\n            Alan was hired as a Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton in Norfolk, Virginia. He was able to help the Navy gauge readiness for Nuclear-powered Aircraft Carriers."

The verb haber is used as an auxiliary (helping) verb as follows:\n\nCompound tenses Example (in the 1st person sing.)\n\nPresent Perfect (or Perfect) Indicative\n\nhe hablado (I have spoken)\n\nPluperfect (or Past Perfect) Indicative\n\nhabía hablado (I had spoken)\n\nPreterit Perfect (or Past Anterior)\n\nhube hablado (I had spoken)\n\nFuture Perfect (or Future Anterior)\n\nhabré hablado (I will have spoken)\n\nConditional Perfect\n\nhabría hablado (I would have spoken)\n\nPresent Perfect (or Past) Subjunctive\n\nhaya hablado (I may have spoken)\n\nPluperfect (or Past Perfect) Subjunctive\n\nhubiera hablado or hubiese hablado (I might have spoken)\n\n\nThe verb haber is also used to form: - the perfect (or past) infinitive: haber hablado (to have spoken). As you can see, this is formed by using the infinitive form of haber + the past participle of the main verb.\n\nthe perfect participle: habiendo hablado (having spoken). This is formed by using the present participle of haber + the past participle of the main verb.\n\nThe verb haber + de + inf. is equivalent to the English use of “to be supposed to…” or “to be to…”\n\nMaría ha de traer un pastel, yo he de traer el helado, y mis amigos han de traer las bebidas\n\nMary is supposed to bring a cake, I am supposed to bring the ice cream, and my friends are supposed to bring the drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote on hay and hay que + inf.\nThe word hay is not a verb. You might look at it as an impersonal irregular form of haber. Actually, the word is composed of ha + the archaic y, meaning there. It is generally seen as an adverbial expression because it points out that something or someone “is there.” Its English equivalent is There is… or There are…\n\nFor example: Hay muchos libros en la mesa/There are many books on the table; Hay veinte alumnos en esta clase/There are twenty students in this class.\n\nHay que + inf. is an impersonal expression that denotes an obligation and it is commonly translated into English as: One must… or It is necessary to…\n\nExamples: Hay que estudiar para aprender/It is necessary to study in order to learn; Hay que comer para vivir/One must eat in order to live.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nread_csv(\"haber.csv\") %&gt;% \n  select(tense,mood, \"YO\",\"TÚ\",\"ÉL/ELLA/USTED\",\"NOSOTROS\",\"VOSOTROS\",\"ELLOS/ELLAS/USTEDES\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(tense = tense %&gt;% str_to_title) %&gt;% \n  group_by(mood) %&gt;%  \n  gt() %&gt;% \n  tab_header(\n      title = paste(\"Conjugation of haber\"),\n      subtitle = md(glue::glue(sprintf(\"English: *have*\\n\n                                     Gerundio: *habiendo*\\n\n                                     Pasado Participio: *habido*\")))) %&gt;%\n    cols_align(\n      align = c(\"right\"),\n      columns = everything()) %&gt;% \n    cols_align(\n      align = c(\"left\"),\n      columns = tense) %&gt;% \n    my_gt_theme()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConjugation of haber\n\n\n\n\nEnglish: have\n\nGerundio: habiendo\nPasado Participio: habido\n\n\ntense\nYO\nTÚ\nÉL/ELLA/USTED\nNOSOTROS\nVOSOTROS\nELLOS/ELLAS/USTEDES\n\n\n\n\nIndicativo\n\n\nPresente\nhe\nhas\nha\nhemos\nhabéis\nhan\n\n\nImperfecto\nhabía\nhabías\nhabía\nhabíamos\nhabíais\nhabían\n\n\nPretérito\nhube\nhubiste\nhubo\nhubimos\nhubisteis\nhubieron\n\n\nFuturo\nhabré\nhabrás\nhabrá\nhabremos\nhabréis\nhabrán\n\n\nPotencial Simple\nhabría\nhabrías\nhabría\nhabríamos\nhabríais\nhabrían\n\n\nPerfecto\nhe\nhas\nha\nhemos\nhabéis\nhan\n\n\nPluscuamperfecto\nhabía habido\nhabías habido\nhabía habido\nhabíamos habido\nhabíais habido\nhabían habido\n\n\nPretérito Anterior\nhube habido\nhubiste habido\nhubo habido\nhubimos habido\nhubisteis habido\nhubieron habido\n\n\nFuturo Perfecto\nhabré habido\nhabrás habido\nhabrá habido\nhabremos habido\nhabréis habido\nhabrán habido\n\n\nPotencial Compuesto\nhabría habido\nhabrías habido\nhabría habido\nhabríamos habido\nhabríais habido\nhabrían habido\n\n\nSubjuntivo\n\n\nPresente\nhaya\nhayas\nhaya\nhayamos\nhayáis\nhayan\n\n\nImperfecto\nhubiera\nhubieras\nhubiera\nhubiéramos\nhubierais\nhubieran\n\n\nImperfecto\nhubiese\nhubieses\nhubiese\nhubiésemos\nhubieseis\nhubiesen\n\n\nPerfecto\nhaya habido\nhayas habido\nhaya habido\nhayamos habido\nhayáis habido\nhayan habido\n\n\nPluscuamperfecto\nhubiera habido\nhubieras habido\nhubiera habido\nhubiéramos habido\nhubierais habido\nhubieran habido\n\n\nPluscuamperfecto\nhubiese habido\nhubieses habido\nhubiese habido\nhubiésemos habido\nhubieseis habido\nhubiesen habido\n\n\nImperativo\n\n\nNA\nhé; no\nhayas\nhaya\nhayamos\nhabed; no hayáis\nhayan"

It is used in many everyday expressions and situations. Please note that this verb is commonly used in the third person singular or plural, as in the examples below.\n\n(a) Essentially, the verb gustar means to be pleasing to…\n(b) In English, we say, for example, I like ice cream. In Spanish, we say Me gusta el helado; that is to say, “Ice cream is pleasing to me (Literally: To me, ice cream is pleasing).”\n(c) In English, the thing that you like is the direct object. In Spanish, the thing that you like is the subject. Also, in Spanish, the person who likes the thing is the indirect object: to me, to you, etc. For example: “A Roberto le gusta el helado/Robert likes ice cream (Literally: To Robert, ice cream is pleasing to him).”\n(d) In Spanish, therefore, the verb gustar is used in the third person, either in the singular or plural, when you talk about something that you like— something that is pleasing to you. Therefore, the verb form must agree with the subject; if the thing that is liked is singular, the verb is third person singular: Me gusta el café/I like coffee. If the thing that is liked is plural, the verb gustar is third person plural: “Me gustan el café y la leche/I like coffee and milk (Literally: Coffee and milk are pleasing to me).”\n(e) When you mention the person or the persons who like something, you must use the preposition a in front of the person. You must also use the indirect object pronoun that is associated with the person: A los muchachos y a las muchachas les gusta jugar/Boys and girls like to play. (Literally: To boys and girls, to play is pleasing to them.)"
